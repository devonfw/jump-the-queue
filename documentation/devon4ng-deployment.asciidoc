= Deploy a devon4ng Application

If you have a finished version of your app and want to deploy it somewhere, you only need to make sure that all tests are passed and that your app compiles correctly (this is tested continuously during `ng serve`). After this, run the following command inside your `angular` root folder:

`devon ng build`

This will compile the project and generate a folder called `dist`, which will contain all your TypeScript code transpiled into pure JavaScript:

You can also use the `devon ng deploy` command to automatically deploy your project to a cloud platform of your choice. For more information on this, please read the guide on https://angular.io/guide/deployment#automatic-deployment-with-the-cli[automatic deployment with the Angular/CLI].
