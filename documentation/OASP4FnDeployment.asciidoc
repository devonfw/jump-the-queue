= Deployment of OASP4Fn Applications
The deployment is performed by the serverless framework and it's quite simple, you only have to run the following command to deploy the full service:

`sls deploy`

[IMPORTANT]
====
This command will fail if the AWS credentials are missing. For more information see https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/[serverless credentials]
====

When the deploy is finish with no errors, you will have a command line output with the endpoints and the functions deployed.

Note that until now we have been working locally, so if we gonna deploy our handlers and make them work, we should change the endpoint of our services:

[source, typescript]
----
oasp4fn.setDB(dynamo, {endpoint: 'https://dynamodb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com'});
----

[NOTE]
====
You can get more information about the deployment in the https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/deploy/[serverless documentation], but be aware that OASP4Fn doesn't support the deployment of a single function.
