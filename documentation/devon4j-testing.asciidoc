= Testing with devon4j
Testing our applications is one of the most important parts of the development. The _devon4j_ documentation provides detailed information about the https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/wiki/guide-testing[testing principles]. In addition to that, you can also find information about the topic in the https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-guide[devonfw guide].

In this chapter we are going to focus on showing some test examples, and explain briefly how to start testing our _devon4j_ apps.

== MyThaiStar Testing Example
In all the _devon4j_ projects (based on _Maven_ and _Spring_) we are going to find a dedicated package for testing.

In addition to this, the testing part of the project also has its own _resources_ package, so we are going to be able to configure the application properties or other resources to create specific test scenarios:

image::images/devon4j/8.Testing/mythaistar_testing_structure.png[MyThaiStar Testing Structure, 250]

We should incorporate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing[unit tests] as one of our main efforts during development, even considering approaches like https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html[test-driven development] (TDD).

The tests in our applications should cover a significant amount of functionality. However, in this part of the tutorial, we are going to focus on the test of our _devon4j_ components.

As you have seen in the previous image, each component of our application should have a dedicated package for testing in the test _package_. Inside each testing package, we will create the related test classes. They should follow this naming convention:

----
[Component]Test.java
----

This is because we are going to use _Maven_ to launch the tests of our application and _Maven_ will look for test classes that end with the _Test_ keyword.

Testing under _devon4j_ means, that we already have _Spring Test_ and the _devon4j_ test module available. This also means, that we will find a significant amount of annotations and implementations, which are going to provide us with all the necessary libraries and tools to create our tests in a really simple way.

Focusing on the component tests means, that we are going to test the implementation of the logic layer of our application. Because of this, you can see in our test structure, that our test classes are inside the `[component].logic.impl` package: 

image::images/devon4j/8.Testing/mythaistar_testing_structure.png[MyThaiStar Testing Structure, 250]

If we open one of the test classes we will find something like this:

[source,java]
----
...

@SpringBootTest(classes = SpringBootApp.class)
public class DishmanagementTest extends ComponentTest {

  @Inject
  private Dishmanagement dishmanagement;

  @Test
  public void findAllDishes() {

    DishSearchCriteriaTo criteria = new DishSearchCriteriaTo();
    List<CategoryEto> categories = new ArrayList<>();
    criteria.setCategories(categories);
    PageRequest pageable = PageRequest.of(0, 100, new Sort(Direction.DESC, "price"));
    criteria.setPageable(pageable);
    Page<DishCto> result = this.dishmanagement.findDishCtos(criteria);
    assertThat(result).isNotNull();
  }

  ...

}
----

* *_@SpringBootTest_* is the _Spring Test_ annotation to load the context of our application. So we will have the application running like in a _real_ situation.
* Extending the _devon4j_ test class `ComponentTest` will inject functionalities like http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/[assertions] into our test class.
* _Spring Test_ gives us the option for dependency injection, so we are going to be able to `@Inject` our components to test them.
* Finally with the `@Test` annotation we can declare a test to be executed during the testing process.

== Testing our Application
Now that we have brief overview, we are going to add some tests to our _JumpTheQueue_ application.

We have a main component for managing _visitors_, so we are going to create a dedicated package for testing that component within the `com.devonfw.application.jtqj` package, called `visitormanagement.logic.impl`. Inside this new package we are going to add a new test class named `VisitormanagementTest.java`:

image::images/devon4j/8.Testing/jumpthequeue_testing_structure.png[JumpTheQuehe Testing Structure, 300]

[NOTE]
====
You can see that we already have some test packages in the `src/test/java/com.devonfw.application.jtqj.general` package. Those tests are from the _devon4j_ archetype and we can use them as a model for further tests in our apps.
====

In the `VisitormanagementTest` class we are going to add annotations to run our app in the correct context when executing tests, extend the `ComponentTest` class to obtain assertions, and inject our `visitormanagement` component:

[source,java]
----
...

import javax.inject.Inject;

import org.junit.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

import com.devonfw.application.jtqj.SpringBootApp;
import com.devonfw.application.jtqj.visitormanagement.logic.api.Visitormanagement;
import com.devonfw.application.jtqj.visitormanagement.logic.api.to.VisitorEto;
import com.devonfw.application.jtqj.visitormanagement.logic.api.to.VisitorSearchCriteriaTo;
import com.devonfw.module.test.common.base.ComponentTest;

@SpringBootTest(classes = SpringBootApp.class)
public class VisitormanagementTest extends ComponentTest {

  @Inject
  private Visitormanagement visitormanagement;
}
----

[NOTE]
====
Please note, that the class `VisitormanagementTest` in the code snippet above, *extends* the class `ComponentTest`. Make sure, that this is the case in your code too.
====

Now we can start adding our first test. In link:jump-the-queue-design.asciidoc[JumpTheQueue] we have two main functionalities:

. Register a visitor, returning an _access code_.
. List the current _visitors_.

Let's add tests to check these functionalities:

=== 1. Registration
We are going to create a method with a descriptive name; _saveVisitorTest_, and we are going to add the `@Test` annotation to it.

Inside this test, we are going to verify the registration process of our app. To do so, we only need to call the _saveVisitor_ method of the component and provide a _VisitorEto_ object. After the method is called, we are going to check the response of the method, to verify that the expected business logic has been executed correctly:

[source,java]
----
...

@SpringBootTest(classes = SpringBootApp.class)
public class VisitormanagementTest extends ComponentTest {

  ...
  
  @Test
  public void saveVisitorTest() {

    VisitorEto visitorEto = new VisitorEto();
    visitorEto.setName("Mary");
    visitorEto.setUsername("mary@mary.com");
    visitorEto.setPhoneNumber("123456789");
    visitorEto.setPassword("test");
    visitorEto.setUserType(false);
    visitorEto.setAcceptedTerms(true);
    visitorEto.setAcceptedCommercial(true);
    VisitorEto visitorEtoResult = this.visitormanagement.saveVisitor(visitorEto);

    assertThat(visitorEtoResult.getId()).isNotNull();

    this.visitormanagement.deleteVisitor(visitorEtoResult.getId());
  }

}
----

[NOTE]
====
In this `saveVisitorTest` method, that we give as an example, we can see that theres a `deleteVisitor` at the end. This would normally only be done, if the tests were run against a production database.If you use a separate database for testing, the last delete is not needed.
====

[NOTE]
====
Have you noticed, that the _mock_ data of this test is the same data, that we used in previous chapters for the _manual_ verification of our services? Exactly! From now on, this test will allow us to _automate_ the manual verification process.
====

Now is the time for running the test:

We can do this in several ways, but to simplify the example, just right click the test-method and select `Run as > JUnit Test`:

image::images/devon4j/8.Testing/jumpthequeue_testing_runtest.png[JumpTheQueue Running Tests]

[NOTE]
====
We can also debug our tests using the `Debug As > JUnit Test` option.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you get an error-message saying: `No tests found with test runner 'JUnit 5'`, right-click the test-class, `Run As > Run Configurations...` and then select `JUnit 4` as your test runner:

image::images/devon4j/8.Testing/jumpthequeue_testing_junit5_error.png[JumpTheQueue Running Tests]
====

//TODO: Test fails... continue here!

The result of the test will be shown in the _JUnit_ tab of Eclipse:

image::images/devon4j/8.Testing/jumpthequeue_testing_result.png[JumpTheQueue Test Results 1]

Seems that everything went ok, our register process passes the test. Let's complete the test checking if the just created user is _"Mary"_.

We can do it simply adding more _asserts_ to check the _result_ object

[source,java]
----
assertThat(visitorEtoResult.getName()).isEqualTo("Mary");
----

Now running again the test we should obtain the expected result

image::images/devon4j/8.Testing/jumpthequeue_testing_result2.png[umpTheQueue Test Results 2]

=== 2. Finding Visitors

For the second functionality (finding visitors) we can add a new test with a very similar approach. The only difference is that in this case we are going to need to declare a _Search Criteria_ object, that will contain a pageable to recover the first page and the first 100 values.

[source,java]
----
  @Test
  public void findVisitorsTest() {

    VisitorSearchCriteriaTo criteria = new VisitorSearchCriteriaTo();
    Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(0, 100);
    criteria.setPageable(pageable);
    Page<VisitorEto> result = this.visitormanagement.findVisitors(criteria);

    assertThat(result).isNotNull();
  }
----

Use `*import* org.springframework.data.domain` to solve the errors.
To run both tests (all the tests included in the class) we only need to do right click in any part of the class and select _Run As > JUnit Test_. All the methods annotated with `@Test` will be checked.

image::images/devon4j/8.Testing/jumpthequeue_testing_result3.png[umpTheQueue Test Results 3]

=== Extra Functionalities
The _devon4j_ test module provide us with some extra functionalities that we can use to create tests in an easier way.

Extending _ComponentTest_ class we also have available the _doSetUp()_ and _doTearDown()_ methods, that we can use to initialize and release resources in our test classes.

In our _JumpTheQueue_ test class we could declare the _visitor_ object in the _doSetUp_ method, so we can use this resource in several test methods instead of declaring it again and again.

Doing this our test class would be as follows

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootTest(classes = SpringBootApp.class)
public class VisitormanagementTest extends ComponentTest{

	private VisitorEto visitorEto = new VisitorEto();

	@Inject
	private Visitormanagement visitormanagement;


	@Override
	protected void doSetUp() {
		visitorEto.setName("Mary");
		visitorEto.setUsername("mary@mary.com");
		visitorEto.setPhoneNumber("123456789");
		visitorEto.setPassword("test");
		visitorEto.setUserType(false);
		visitorEto.setAcceptedTerms(true);
		visitorEto.setAcceptedCommercial(true);
	}


  @Test
  public void saveVisitorTest() {

    VisitorEto visitorEtoResult = this.visitormanagement.saveVisitor(visitorEto);

    assertThat(visitorEtoResult.getId()).isNotNull();
    assertThat(visitorEtoResult.getName()).isEqualTo("Mary");

    this.visitormanagement.deleteVisitor(visitorEtoResult.getId());
  }

  @Test
  public void findVisitorsTest() {

    VisitorSearchCriteriaTo criteria = new VisitorSearchCriteriaTo();
    Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(0, 100);
    criteria.setPageable(pageable);
    Page<VisitorEto> result = this.visitormanagement.findVisitors(criteria);

    assertThat(result).isNotNull();
  }
}
----

== Running the Tests with Maven
We can use _Maven_ to automate the testing of our project. To do so, just open a command prompt with access to _Maven_ (in our devonfw project folder we can simply right click and select `Open Devon CMD shell here`). Now enter and run:

----
C:\...\workspaces\main\jump-the-queue\java\jtqj> mvn clean test
----

_Maven_ will now scan for classes containing the word "Test" and execute all methods annotated with `@Test` in those classes. The result will look similar to this:

image::images/devon4j/8.Testing/jumpthequeue_testing_maven.png[JumpTheQueue Maven Testing]

Even though the test we made finished correctly, there are more tests -- that devon4j generated automatically -- which are going to contain one error related to role assignment. In this tutorial we are only going to implement the visitor side, so we won't implement role restrictions. We encourage you to add the code for this functionality yourself, after finishing this tutorial.

After we have demonstrated how to create tests in _devonfw_, we are going to show you how to package and deploy your project in the next chapter.
