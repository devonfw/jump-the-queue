This Tutorial explains how to setup Visual Studio Code to work on and contribute to devon4ng projects with your Windows computer.

To get started follow these steps:

. Download and install https://gitforwindows.org/[Git for Windows]:
+
IMPORTANT: Install with the option `Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt` but *without* Windows Explorer integration!
+

+
* For Windows Explorer integration install https://tortoisegit.org/[Tortoise Git] (optional)

. Download and install the _recommended_ https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework[.NET Framework] Runtime & Developer Pack

. Download and install the _latest_ https://adoptopenjdk.net/[AdoptOpen JDK] (with the HotSpot JVM):
+
* During installation activate the option for `Set JAVA_HOME variable`
+

+
IMPORTANT: *Reboot* your PC to put the newly set JAVA_HOME variable into effect!

. Get *Visual Studio Code*:
+
* If you are *NOT* a member of Capgemini, download https://code.visualstudio.com/[VS Code], install and run it.
+
* If you *ARE* a member of Capgemini, download the _current_ http://de-mucevolve02/files/devonfw/current/[devonfw distribution] and unzip it to a directory of your choice. Navigate to `~\software\vscode` and run `Code.exe`.

. Install the *devonfw Platform Extension Pack* for VS Code:
* In VS Code, select the 'Extensions' icon in the Activity Bar to the left, then search and install the `devonfw Platform Extension Pack` ...
* or follow https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=devonfw.devonfw-extension-pack[this link], click 'Install', confirm the dialogue and open the URL with VS Code.

. Download and install the _current_ version of https://nodejs.org/[Node.js]

. Install *TypeScript* support and the *Angular CLI*:
* In VS Code, open a command prompt via `Terminal > New Terminal`
* now run the command `npm install –g typescript`
* also run the command `npm install –g @angular/cli`
+
TIP: You can check, what modules you have installed by running `npm list -g`. You can also check, what version of the Angular CLI you are using by running `ng version`.

. (OPTIONAL) Configure Yarn to be your package manager:

* Download and install the _stable_ version of https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable[Yarn]
* Now run the command `ng config -g cli.packageManager yarn`
+
NOTE: We feel like Yarn is quite a bit faster and generally more usable than npm. However, if you are already familiar with npm, you can contiue using it.

Finally, if you are using the *devonfw distribution*, we recommend storing all your devon4ng projects in the folder `workspaces_vs`. This allows you to execute the script `update-all-workspaces.bat`, in order to generate a launch script for each individual project called `vscode-<YourProjectName>.bat`.
